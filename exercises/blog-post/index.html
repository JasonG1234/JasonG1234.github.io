            <p class="p">
                Fallout 4 follows the "Sole Survivor" who emerges from 
                cryosleep in Vault 111 in 2287, 210 years after a 
                nuclear war, to find their spouse murdered and son, 
                Shaun, kidnapped. Set in the Commonwealth (Boston area), 
                the player navigates, rebuilds settlements, and uncovers a 
                conspiracy involving the Institute. The journey culminates in 
                a choice between four main factions—the Institute, 
                Brotherhood of Steel, Railroad, and 
                Minutemen—to decide the wasteland's future.

                In Fallout 4, Deathclaws are top-tier, aggressive apex 
                predators with thick hides, high health (up to 91+ level 
                variants), and devastating, fast-striking claw attacks. 
                Defeating them requires targeting their weaker belly, 
                crippling their legs to slow them, or using high-damage 
                weaponry like rifles and miniguns. They are found across 
                the Commonwealth and can yield top-tier loot.

                The four main factions in Fallout 4, vying for control 
                of the Commonwealth, are the Minutemen, focused on 
                civilian defense; the Brotherhood of Steel, a technologically 
                advanced military force; the Railroad, dedicated to freeing 
                Synths; and the Institute, a shadowy scientific organization 
                creating Synths. Your choices with these groups determine 
                the game's ending.
