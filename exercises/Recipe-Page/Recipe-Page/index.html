        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Whisk together the unsalted butter, granulated white 
                        sugar, and light brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Then add the unsweetened cocoa powder, salt, espresso 
                        powder, vanilla extract, vegetable oil, 
                        and heavy cream.Whisk again and then pop in 
                        the microwave for  30 seconds. 
                        It shouldn't be hot, just warm. Whisk together to 
                        dissolve the sugar and cocoa powder.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Once smooth, add the eggs and whisk really well 
                        until combined. Beat for about a minute to
                        help fluff up the batter.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Now add the all purpose flour and mix until you 
                        have a thick batter consistency.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Finally, mix in the chocolate chips! You can mix 
                        them into the batter or another option is to sprinkle
                        them on top in the pan.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Transfer the batter to a 9x9 tray that's been 
                        lined with parchment paper. Smooth the top with a 
                        rubber spatula and pop in the oven at 350°F to 
                        bake for about 30 to 35 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Once they're out of the oven, allow them to cool down 
                        for about 25 minutes until set. 
                        Then cut them into individual pieces to enjoy!
